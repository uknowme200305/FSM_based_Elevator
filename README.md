# ðŸš€ Elevator Controller in Verilog (FSM + FIFO-Based)

A feature-rich **Elevator Controller** designed using **Finite State Machine (FSM)** and **FIFO-based request queuing**, implemented in **Verilog HDL**. This project simulates the behavior of a real-world elevator system and is ideal for RTL design and digital logic learners preparing for VLSI roles.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- âœ… FSM-driven state transitions: IDLE, MOVING, DOOR_OPEN, ALARM, EMERGENCY
- âœ… FIFO-based floor request queue with dynamic enqueue and dequeue
- âœ… Floor call handling with request filtering
- âœ… Alarm and Emergency handling modules
- âœ… Timed door open state with configurable timer
- âœ… Synchronous logic with clean reset behavior

//OUTPUTS are as follows (for the attached test bench)
